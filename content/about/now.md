This page is inspired by all the pages on [Nownownow](https://nownownow.com/). This page lists everything that I am currently working on (and what's generally going on in my life)

## Professional Life

I am currently working at [Digital H](https://digital-h.de), where I am the product and development lead for the [WSW Ticket App](/projects/wsw-ticket). My goals for this year include:

- Create a new concept on how a public transport app can adapt to the user and not the other way around to provide the most direct and intuitive way of using public transport in Germany
- Improve internal knowledge sharing by organizing internal presentations so that colleagues can profit from each other's findings

Besides these work tasks I am planning to accustom myself with *Golang* through developing a feed aggregator called [freed](/projects/freed).

## Personal Life

While nearing my 30th birthday it became clear that it gets more and more important to keep up friendships. A strong social circle is the foundation for a healthy life so I am going to make it a priority to nurture the friendships and family bonds I currently have.

For my sports life I plan to do at least three [triathlons](/about/triathlon) this year:

- [Wörthsee Triathlon](https://woerthseetriathlon.de/) (Wörthsee, Bavaria, Germany) *I will be a part of a relay team together with my father*
- [Ironman 70.3 Westfriesland](https://www.ironman.com/im703-westfriesland) (Hoorn, Netherlands)
- [XTerra Sprint Lake Garda](https://www.xterraplanet.com/race/xterra-lake-garda-sprint-triathlon) (Toscolano-Maderno, Italy)

There are no specific time goals for these competitions, though I would be happy to achieve the following sports-wise:

- Sub 30 minute swim at the Wörthsee Triathlon (1500m)
- Sub 6 hours Ironman 70.3
- Sub 20 minute 5k run

There is also something important happening for at the end of this year, which I cannot disclose as of yet. It is going to be posted here as soon as it happens.

I do like to self-host a lot of the applications I use. This allows me to get a deeper understanding on how different technologies work, give me an opportunity to learn and to benefit from the great OSS community providing these services. A lot of the tools were discovered on the [awesome-selfhosted repository](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).
